Project Objective - To develop a comprehensive credit card weekly dashboard that provides real-time insight into key performance metric and trends, enabling stakeholders to monitor and analyze credit card operations effectively.

-> Import Data to SQL Database 
1. Prepare csv file
2. create tables in SQL

 Create a database 
CREATE DATABASE ccdb;

-- 1. Create cc_detail table

CREATE TABLE cc_detail (
    Client_Num INT,
    Card_Category VARCHAR(20),
    Annual_Fees INT,
    Activation_30_Days INT,
    Customer_Acq_Cost INT,
    Week_Start_Date DATE,
    Week_Num VARCHAR(20),
    Qtr VARCHAR(10),
    current_year INT,
    Credit_Limit DECIMAL(10,2),
    Total_Revolving_Bal INT,
    Total_Trans_Amt INT,
    Total_Trans_Ct INT,
    Avg_Utilization_Ratio DECIMAL(10,3),
    Use_Chip VARCHAR(10),
    Exp_Type VARCHAR(50),
    Interest_Earned DECIMAL(10,3),
    Delinquent_Acc VARCHAR(5)
);


-- 2. Create cc_detail table

CREATE TABLE cust_detail (
    Client_Num INT,
    Customer_Age INT,
    Gender VARCHAR(5),
    Dependent_Count INT,
    Education_Level VARCHAR(50),
    Marital_Status VARCHAR(20),
    State_cd VARCHAR(50),
    Zipcode VARCHAR(20),
    Car_Owner VARCHAR(5),
    House_Owner VARCHAR(5),
    Personal_Loan VARCHAR(5),
    Contact VARCHAR(50),
    Customer_Job VARCHAR(50),
    Income INT,
    Cust_Satisfaction_Score INT
);


-- 3. Copy csv data into SQL (remember to update the file name and file location in below query)

-- copy cc_detail table

COPY cc_detail
FROM 'D:\credit_card.csv' 
DELIMITER ',' 
CSV HEADER;


-- copy cust_detail table

COPY cust_detail
FROM 'D:\customer.csv' 
DELIMITER ',' 
CSV HEADER;

-- 4. Insert additional data into SQL, using same COPY function

-- copy additional data (week-53) in cc_detail table

COPY cc_detail
FROM 'D:\cc_add.csv' 
DELIMITER ',' 
CSV HEADER;


-- copy additional data (week-53) in cust_detail table (remember to update the file name and file location in below query)

COPY cust_detail
FROM 'D:\cust_add.csv' 
DELIMITER ',' 
CSV HEADER;




-> DAX Queries   
 AgeGroup = SWITCH(
 TRUE(),
 'public cust_detail'[customer_age] < 30, "20-30",
 'public cust_detail'[customer_age] >= 30 && 'public cust_detail'[customer_age] < 40, "30-40",
 'public cust_detail'[customer_age] >= 40 && 'public cust_detail'[customer_age] < 50, "40-50",
 'public cust_detail'[customer_age] >= 50 && 'public cust_detail'[customer_age] < 60, "50-60",
 'public cust_detail'[customer_age] >= 60, "60+",
 "unknown"
 )
 IncomeGroup = SWITCH(
 TRUE(),
 'public cust_detail'[income] < 35000, "Low",
 'public cust_detail'[income] >= 35000 && 'public cust_detail'[income] <70000, "Med",
 'public cust_detail'[income] >= 70000, "High",
 "unknown"
 )

 
  week_num2 = WEEKNUM('public cc_detail'[week_start_date])
 Revenue = 'public cc_detail'[annual_fees] + 'public cc_detail'[total_trans_amt] + 'public cc_detail'[interest_earned]
 Current_week_Reveneue = CALCULATE(
 SUM('public cc_detail'[Revenue]),
 FILTER(
 ALL('public cc_detail'),
 'public cc_detail'[week_num2] = MAX('public cc_detail'[week_num2]))) 
Previous_week_Reveneue = CALCULATE(
 SUM('public cc_detail'[Revenue]),
 FILTER(
 ALL('public cc_detail'),
 'public cc_detail'[week_num2] = MAX('public cc_detail'[week_num2])-1))
